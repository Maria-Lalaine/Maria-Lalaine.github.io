    <p class="centered-text1"> Beyond photography and graphic editing, I have a flair for birthday decorations. As a part-time birthday decorator, I bring joy and excitement to special occasions by curating beautiful and memorable setups. From balloons to themes, I love adding a touch of magic to birthdays and creating an enchanting atmosphere.

Lastly, my expertise extends to video editing. I have honed my skills in crafting visually compelling narratives through video. Whether it's a promotional video, a short film, or a montage, I enjoy weaving together footage, music, and effects to create engaging visual stories.
